# Image Setup Instructions

## What I've Done

✅ **Updated Portfolio Component** - All placeholder images now point to your specific image files
✅ **Updated HTML Favicon** - Added favicon references to the icons folder  
✅ **Created Organized Folder Structure** - Ready for your images
✅ **Updated Documentation** - Clear instructions for your specific needs

## What You Need To Do

### 1. Add Your Favicon ✅ DONE
Your favicon is already in place:
```
📁 C:\Users\Dinis\Documents\GitHub\portfolio-v2\public\images\icons\
   └── favicon.png ✅
```

**Note:** HTML has been updated to use your PNG favicon.

### 2. Add Your Project Images
Copy these specific files to:
```
📁 C:\Users\Dinis\Documents\GitHub\portfolio-v2\public\images\projects\
   ├── e-agenda.png      (for E-agenda project)
   ├── car.png           (for Car Insurance Database Application)
   ├── stock.png         (for Stock Replacement Application)
   └── tracker.png       (for Expense Tracker)
```

## Current Image Mappings

The Portfolio component now uses these paths:

| Project | Image Path | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| E-agenda | `/images/projects/e-agenda.png` | ⏳ Waiting for your image |
| Car Insurance | `/images/projects/car.png` | ⏳ Waiting for your image |
| Stock Replacement | `/images/projects/stock.png` | ⏳ Waiting for your image |
| Expense Tracker | `/images/projects/tracker.png` | ⏳ Waiting for your image |
| Personal Portfolio | `/images/icons/coding-icon.svg` | ✅ Using created icon |

## Testing Your Images

1. **Copy your images** to the specified folders
2. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Check your portfolio** at `http://localhost:5173`
4. **Verify images load** in the Portfolio section

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG recommended for screenshots, ICO for favicon
- **Size**: 1200x800px recommended for project thumbnails
- **Quality**: High quality but optimized for web

## Troubleshooting

If images don't appear:
1. Check the file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Ensure images are in the correct folders
3. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5)
4. Check browser console for errors

## Next Steps

After adding your images:
1. Test the portfolio in development mode
2. Consider adding more screenshots for project galleries
3. Optimize images if page loads slowly
4. Update alt text if needed for accessibility

**Note**: The coding icon (`</> `) is already created and being used for the Personal Portfolio project. You can replace it with your own icon if preferred.
